# Emotion-Detector-by-Python
An Emotion Detector in Python is a program that analyzes data (typically text, images, or audio) to classify or infer emotions expressed in the input. This is accomplished by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, or Audio Signal Processing techniques, often combined with machine learning or deep learning models.
Features

- **Text-Based Emotion Detection:**
  - Analyzes written text for emotional sentiment using NLP techniques.
  - Supports multi-class emotion classification (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).

- **Facial Emotion Recognition:**
  - Detects emotions by analyzing facial expressions in images or real-time video feeds.
  - Uses pre-trained deep learning models for accurate detection.

- **Audio Emotion Analysis:**
  - Processes speech or audio signals to infer emotions.
  - Extracts features like pitch, tone, and intensity for classification.

- **Hybrid Emotion Detection:**
  - Combines text, facial, and audio analysis for multi-modal emotion recognition.
